# PPO-on-cartpole
Project Overview


This project implements Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to solve the CartPole-v1 reinforcement learning environment using Python. The PPO algorithm, a policy gradient method developed by OpenAI, is designed for stable and efficient learning in reinforcement learning tasks.



The goal of this project is to train an agent to balance a pole on a moving cart by optimizing a policy using the PPO algorithm.
